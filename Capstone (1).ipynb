    "#### Introduction \n",
    "With the ever-increasing cost of healthcare, including doctor visits, medications, and hospital stays. Access to quality healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult for many Americans. As the cost of healthcare rises, individuals are often forced to choose health insurance plans that may be affordable but offer limited coverage, leaving them underinsured or, in some cases, entirely uninsured. There is no best route when it comes to insurance as the political nature of public insurance plans and the capitalistic nature of private insurance plans makes selection and affordablity difficult for Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is especially concerning because it may compel people to delay or avoid necessary care due to the inaccessibility of affordable and comprehensive health coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, individuals employed in high-paying, stable jobs have access to comprehensive private insurance plans that cover a wide range of medical services. In contrast, those who are unemployed or work in low-wage jobs are often left with a public insurance option, or none at all, all-particularly if they lack knowledge about how health insurance works. This lack of insurance literacy can further discourage enrollment and compound health disparities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Topic \n",
    "Predicting and explaining health insurance status (private, public only, or uninsured) in the U.S. using demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors from the 2023 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "This project seeks to predict health insurance coverage type among U.S. adults- categorized as private, public only, or uninsured based on a set of demographic, economic, and health characteristics. The success metric will be model performance measured through classification accuracy. The scope of this study is limited to individuals represented in the 2023 MEPS dataset, with emphasis on identifying disparities among low-income and racial minority populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale \n",
    "Understanding determinants of health insurance is critical, as insurance coverage directly shapes access to preventative care, treatment and long-term health outcomes. From a societal perspective, the problem matters because the lack of adequate coverage often leads to delayed treatment, higher long-term "

    "#### Literature Review \n",
    "\n",
    "Rahman and Dua (2025) conducted a large-scale machine learning study using Louisiana Medicaid claims data to predict health outcomes, including clinical service utilization, COVID-19 infection, and tobacco use behavior. Although the study did not focus explicitly on health insurance selection, its findings provide meaningful insights into how individual-level features can drive healthcare-related decisions—factors that are also closely tied to insurance coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors applied a range of supervised learning models and found that ensemble methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperformed traditional algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees across multiple classification tasks. For example, XGBoost achieved a predictive accuracy of 95.3% for clinical service utilization, while logistic regression was only 50.9%. This performance advantage was attributed to the XGBoost models’ ability to capture non-linear relationships and the range of categorical variables commonly found in healthcare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key predictors varied by target outcome. For clinical service utilization, the most influential features were total length of hospital stay, disability status, stroke diagnosis, age, and geographic region. In predicting COVID-19 status, tobacco use and age were dominant factors, while COPD emerged as the strongest predictor for tobacco use itself. These findings highlight the importance of chronic conditions, behavioral factors, and demographic features in shaping health outcomes, healthcare access, and insurance decisions.\n",
    "The study also addressed data imbalance and computational performance. While tree-based models demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness, they required more computational resources. Simpler models like naïve Bayes were faster but less accurate. This underscores the need for balancing predictive power with scalability when applying machine learning in large administrative health datasets.\n",
    "Overall, the study supports the inclusion of features such as age, disability status, region, tobacco use, and chronic disease conditions in predictive models. These same factors are known to influence insurance plan selection in the U.S., making the study a valuable methodological and conceptual reference for understanding the determinants of health insurance choices.\n"

    "#### Justification for Variable Selection \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in this analysis were selected to reflect established determinants of health insurance coverage identified in prior research (McWilliams, Zaslavsky, & Meara, 2013). Demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity) capture systematic disparities in eligibility and access. Socioeconomic indicators (income, education, employment) are critical, as higher income and stable employment predict private coverage, while lower income increases reliance on public programs or risk of being uninsured. Measures of health status and chronic conditions reflect both medical need and pathways to public eligibility. Family and household characteristics account for shared financial risk and eligibility through dependent coverage or Medicaid/CHIP. Finally, regional variation acknowledges state policy differences that shape insurance availability. Together, these variables provide a comprehensive representation of the structural, socioeconomic, and health-related factors that drive differences in insurance type and coverage gaps (McWilliams et al., 2013)."

    "### Justification \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Health insurance status in the United States remains one of the most consequential predictors of access to care, financial stability, and population health outcomes. Despite decades of policy reforms, stark disparities persist in whether individuals hold private coverage, public-only coverage, or remain uninsured. These differences often reflect underlying demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, such as income, employment status, race/ethnicity, immigration status, and chronic health conditions. Understanding and predicting patterns in insurance coverage is critical not only for academic inquiry but also for informing policymakers, health systems, and advocacy organizations seeking to mitigate inequities in access to care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The urgency of this work is heightened by recent federal policy changes. The Republican “megabill,” enacted in July 2025, represents the largest retrenchment of health coverage since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, more than 15 million people are projected to lose health coverage by 2034 as a result of $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and ACA marketplaces. The bill introduces strict work requirements, shortened eligibility verification windows, new bureaucratic hurdles, and restrictions on immigrants lawfully residing in the U.S. As a result, millions of low-income individuals, parents, people with disabilities, and workers just above the poverty threshold are at elevated risk of losing Medicaid or ACA coverage. Moreover, the rollback of enhanced premium tax credits will make marketplace plans unaffordable for millions, disproportionately affecting small business owners, self-employed workers, and households living near the poverty line.\n",
    "\n",
    "These developments underscore why predictive modeling of insurance status using nationally representative survey data is both timely and essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this research, I aim to identify the people who are affected the most by these governmental policy acts . "

    "#### Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I will use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey – Household Component (MEPS-HC) 2023 dataset, a nationally representative survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Administered by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), MEPS-HC provides detailed information on individuals' health status, health insurance coverage, medical expenditures, employment, income, and demographic characteristics. The 2023 dataset includes variables essential for modeling health insurance choice, such as insurance type (private, public, uninsured), plan characteristics, health conditions, service utilization, and out-of-pocket costs."

    "### 2) Literature to back the PCA vulnerability index\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in health services research, often employed to construct composite risk or vulnerability indices from correlated socioeconomic and health care utilization variables. Prior studies commonly integrate measures of income and education with indicators of utilization (e.g., emergency room visits, inpatient admissions) to capture both economic and medical risk within a single score. Typically, the first principal component (PC1) reflects a gradient of higher health care use and lower socioeconomic status, representing greater overall vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a “vulnerability index” originates from research on natural disasters, where it is used to identify populations most at risk of adverse impacts. For example, studies of flood vulnerability have applied PCA-based indices to reveal how varying capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards differ across populations and geographies. These indices are typically composed of indicators spanning social, demographic, economic, and built environment characteristics that jointly shape vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adopting this same conceptual framework in a health services context, socio-economic, demographic, and medical need variables can be aggregated using PCA to create a composite vulnerability index. This index provides a data-driven way to examine how vulnerability relates to patterns of insurance coverage and health care access across populations.\n",

    "Four classification algorithms were trained to predict health insurance type (private, public-only, uninsured) based on socioeconomic, demographic, and vulnerability indicators. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (73.5%), reflecting strong predictive power for private and public coverage but weaker performance identifying uninsured individuals — the most vulnerable group. Feature importance analysis revealed that income, education, employment, and the PCA-derived vulnerability index were the strongest predictors of insurance type. These findings align with prior literature emphasizing the intersection of socioeconomic status and access to care."

    "To determine the most appropriate machine learning model for predicting insurance type, I conducted a comprehensive comparison of multiple supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Histogram Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost. Each model was trained on the same preprocessed dataset, which included demographic characteristics, socioeconomic indicators, healthcare utilization metrics, chronic disease burden, and a PCA-derived vulnerability index. Because the dataset exhibits significant class imbalance—particularly the comparatively small uninsured group—SMOTE oversampling was applied to the training data to ensure fairer class representation and reduce model bias toward majority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was evaluated using macro-averaged F1 scores, weighted F1 scores, and confusion matrices. Macro F1 is especially important in this context because it gives equal weight to each insurance category and therefore reflects performance on the vulnerable uninsured group, which is often the hardest to classify. Weighted F1 complements this by accounting for class imbalance and providing a holistic measure of performance across the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all evaluated models, XGBoost demonstrated the strongest balance of predictive accuracy, robustness to nonlinear relationships, and consistent performance across all insurance categories. It achieved one of the highest macro F1 scores, indicating superior performance on minority classes, and also produced the highest weighted F1 score, suggesting strong overall predictive capability. Confusion matrix results further confirmed that XGBoost was more effective than other models in correctly identifying public-only insurance cases and substantially improved recall for the uninsured population compared to baseline learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based ensemble models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting also performed competitively but exhibited greater misclassification of uninsured individuals and less stable performance across cross-validation folds. Logistic Regression, while interpretable, struggled to capture nonlinear interactions between socioeconomic and health utilization variables. More traditional classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, KNN, and SVM underperformed due to the mixed data types and complex structure inherent in health and socioeconomic determinants of insurance coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these results, XGBoost was selected as the final model for predictive analysis and dashboard integration. Its ability to handle heterogeneous features, model complex relationships, and maintain performance across imbalanced classes makes it the most suitable choice for this application. Additionally, XGBoost provides interpretable outputs—including feature importance metrics—that directly support the project’s broader objective of understanding structural drivers of insurance vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, XGBoost offers the best combination of accuracy, fairness across insurance categories, interpretability, and practical utility, making it the most appropriate model for predicting insurance type and supporting downstream visualization and decision-support components of this capstone project."
